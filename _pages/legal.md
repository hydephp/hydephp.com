# Legal Information

To keep things nice and friendly for everyone, here are some things to keep in mind.
I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. I'm acting in good faith and
ask that you do as well.

## Website Privacy, Cookies, and Analytics

Your privacy and security matter. This website does not use cookies or tracking technologies.[^1]

The only information stored when using this site is your preference for using the dark theme.
This is done using LocalStorage and is stored in your browser, allowing the site to keep
your theme preference selected.

We get basic analytics from GitHub, where this site is hosted. The DNS provider also provides
some statistics. These statistics are completely anonymous, and we cannot trace, track, or
link any of the data to any individual. Please see the respective providers' websites
for more information on how they handle data.

[^1]: While we do not use cookies on our side (since this is a static site without a backend),
some external services may use cookies, for example, if a YouTube video is embedded.
