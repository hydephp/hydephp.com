## Exciting News!

Hi everyone! I'm Emma De Silva, creator and maintainer of HydePHP. I'm excited to share some news with the community about an upcoming speaking engagement.

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be speaking at the **Laravel Meetup Stockholm** Wednesday the first of October! If you're in the area or part of the Laravel community in Stockholm, I'd love to see you there.

## What I'll Be Talking About

My talk will focus on how **HydePHP can supercharge your workflows with Laravel-powered static sites**. We'll explore how HydePHP bridges the gap between the power and elegance of Laravel and the performance and simplicity of static site generation.

Whether you're building documentation, a blog, a portfolio, or any content-driven site, HydePHP offers a familiar Laravel-style development experience while delivering the benefits of static site generation: blazing-fast performance, enhanced security, and effortless deployment.

## HydePHP v2.0 on the Horizon

There are even rumors that **HydePHP v2.0 is right around the corner**! While I can't reveal too much just yet, let's just say there are some exciting developments in the pipeline that will make HydePHP even more powerful and developer-friendly.
