## Creating a HydePHP site on GitHub Pages based on your Readme

Welcome to the HydePHP blog! Today, we're going to show you how to create a simple static site from your GitHub project's `README.md` file using HydePHP and deploy it using GitHub Pages. 

In case you're not already familiar, [HydePHP](https://hydephp.com) is a static site generator that combines the power of Laravel with the simplicity of Markdown. With just a few steps, your next website is minutes away from becoming a reality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository with a `README.md` file.
- GitHub Actions enabled for your repository.
- GitHub Pages enabled for your repository.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Create the Workflow File

First, we need to set up a GitHub Actions workflow file. Create a new file named `.github/workflows/build.yml` in your repository. This workflow will handle the process of converting your `README.md` into a static site and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

**Here is the example workflow:**
```yaml
name: Build Documentation from Readme

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Make sure this matches your default branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create site from Readme
        run: |
          # Here we set up the HydePHP source files to use the README.md as the index page
          mkdir _pages
          mv README.md _pages/index.md
          rm -rf !'_pages'

      - name: Create Hyde config
        run: |
          # Configure the site name
          echo 'name: My Site Name' >> hyde.yml
          # Optionally, load styles from the CDN
          echo 'load_app_styles_from_cdn: true' >> hyde.yml
          # Optionally, use Highlight.js for syntax highlighting
          echo "scripts: '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.7.0/build/styles/atom-one-dark.min.css\"> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.7.0/build/highlight.min.js\"></script> <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script> <style>.prose :where(pre) { background-color: #282c34; } </style> <style>pre code.hljs { padding: 0; }</style>'" >> hyde.yml

      - uses: hydephp/action@master
        with:
          deploy-to: "pages"
```

This workflow performs the following steps:
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Moves the `README.md` file to the `_pages` directory and renames it to `index.md`.
3. Creates a basic HydePHP configuration file (`hyde.yml`) with the site name and optional style settings.
4. Uses the HydePHP GitHub Action to build the site and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

#### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

To deploy your static site, you need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. Click on the **Pages** tab in the sidebar.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** from the **Source** dropdown.

This step allows the HydePHP GitHub Action to deploy your site directly to GitHub Pages.
