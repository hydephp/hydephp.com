**This blog post is to announce that the domain "HydePHP.se" is sunset, in favour of the canonical HydePHP.com.**

If you're reading this, you're on HydePHP.com, and you probably did not even know that HydePHP.se existed. In short, the dot.se domain was originally used for internal HydePHP infrastructure, which has now been moved to the dot.com domain. Thus, the dot.se domain is no longer needed, and will not be renewed.

This is done for two reasons, one: it keeps things simple to only have one domain, and two: it saves money, as HydePHP is an not-for-profit open-source project, which you can support by buying the author a coffee at [www.buymeacoffee.com/caen](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/caen).

Until the domain's expiration, all traffic to HydePHP.se will be redirected to HydePHP.com, and after that, the domain will be released and **will no longer represent HydePHP**.
