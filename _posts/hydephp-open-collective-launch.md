# HydePHP OpenCollective Launch

Hey there HydePHP enthusiasts! My name is Caen, I'm the creator of HydePHP, and I'm excited to share some exciting news with you.

## [HydePHP OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/hydephp)

I'm thrilled to announce that HydePHP now has its own [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/hydephp), providing a platform where users and companies can contribute financially to help fund the development of HydePHP. As you may know, HydePHP is a Laravel-based static site generator that I've been developing in my free time.

### Why OpenCollective?

Running and maintaining an open-source project comes with various expenses, including server hosting costs, development tools, and the creation of quality video content. As a student, I've been covering these costs out of pocket. The OpenCollective model allows HydePHP users and companies to contribute funds directly to support the project's ongoing growth.

## Fiscally Sponsored by the Open Source Collective

To ensure transparency and accountability, HydePHP is fiscally sponsored by the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource). This sponsorship helps manage and allocate funds appropriately, making sure that every contribution goes towards the development and improvement of HydePHP.

### How You Can Contribute

If you find HydePHP valuable and want to contribute to its sustainability and growth, consider making a financial contribution on [HydePHP's OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/hydephp). Every contribution, big or small, makes a difference and goes directly towards supporting the project.

Your support is immensely appreciated, and it will contribute to making HydePHP even better in the future. Thank you for being part of the HydePHP community!

Happy coding! /Caen
