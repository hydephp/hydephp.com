We're thrilled to announce that [HydePHP.com](https://hydephp.com/) is now accepting guest posts from our amazing community! Whether you're a Laravel enthusiast, a static site generation expert, or someone who has built something cool with HydePHP, we want to hear your story.

## Why Write for HydePHP?

- Share your knowledge and experiences with the wider PHP community
- Get recognition with full attribution and links to your profile
- Help others learn and grow while building your personal brand
- Contribute to the open-source community in a meaningful way

## What We're Looking For

We welcome a variety of content that adds value to our community, including:

- Tutorials and how-to guides for HydePHP features
- Case studies of projects built with HydePHP
- Best practices and tips for static site generation
- Integration guides with other Laravel tools and services
- Your unique experiences and insights using HydePHP
- Talk about a package/extension you've built for HydePHP
- Anything else you think is relevant to the HydePHP community

## How to Submit Your Post

1. Fork the [HydePHP.com repository](https://github.com/hydephp/hydephp.com) or use the [GitHub.com website](https://github.com/hydephp/hydephp.com/blob/master/_posts/guest-posts)
2. Create your post file in the `_posts/guest-posts/` directory
3. The filename should be the post title in kebab case
4. Include the required front matter (example below)
5. Submit one post per pull request

Make sure to proofread your post to ensure proper spelling, grammar, and formatting.

**Here's the required front matter template:**

```yaml
title: "Your Engaging Post Title"
description: "A brief 1-2 sentence description of your post"
category: "Guest Posts"
author:
    name: "Your Name"
    website: "https://yourwebsite.com" # Optional
    linkedin: "your_linkedin_handle" # Optional
    github: "your_github_handle" # Optional
    x: "your_x_handle" # Optional
date: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
guest_post: true
canonical_guest_post_url: "https://example.com/original-post" # Optional, for republished content
```

### Style Guide

Please use Markdown formatting for your post, and use a clear heading structure. You don't need to add a level one heading, as HydePHP adds that based on the front matter title. Start with level two headings, and try to only use level two and three headings. 

When using links, make sure these are not overly promotional, and that they only lead to relevant and useful resources. Paid/sponsored affiliate links are not allowed.

## Guidelines and Terms

To ensure a positive experience for everyone, please note:

- All posts must follow our [Code of Conduct](https://hydephp.com/code-of-conduct)
- Contributors retain copyright of their content while granting us publication rights
- We reserve the right to:
  - Accept or decline submissions
  - Schedule posts for optimal publishing dates
  - Remove content that violates our guidelines
  - Make minor edits for formatting and clarity

For republished content, we're happy to include canonical links to the original post, provided it aligns with our community guidelines.

### Legal Considerations

### AI Usage Guidelines

We welcome the use of AI as a supportive writing tool, as long as human creativity remains at the forefront. Hereâ€™s our stance:

**Acceptable AI usage:**
- Using AI tools for proofreading and editing
- Getting feedback on structure and clarity
- Brainstorming ideas and topics
- Suggesting improvements to your writing

However, we do not accept purely AI-generated content. All posts must be primarily written by humans, with AI serving as a supplementary tool rather than the primary author.
