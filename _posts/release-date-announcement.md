### Announcement

**Preliminary release date HydePHP v1.0 is set to March 14, 2023**, exactly one year after the [Initial Commit](https://github.com/hydephp/hyde/commit/109bddb7b6144ba704e283c220754759276f1a23).

### Feature freeze

Feature freeze will take effect either March 1 or March 7 at the latest, upon which the documentation will be finalized and the backwards compatibility promise will be kicked in. Any remaining planned breaking changes must be resolved before then, as shall any existing deprecated or experimental code.

### Release candidate

The first HydePHP v1.0-RC version will be published tied to the feature freeze. Only bug fixes will be merged during that time frame, barring any critical issue being discovered that needs addressing in a breaking way. This is so that we don't accidentally merge in any unstable code with too little time to fix before the release causing unnecessary delays.
