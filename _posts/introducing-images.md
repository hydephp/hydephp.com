>warning Heads up! This article is quite old. Take a look at the official documentation for the latest information.

The v0.10.0 release introduces featured images for blog posts.

Add images to your posts by setting the `image` in the front matter. If you pass a string it will be used to find an image in the `_media` directory if the file is local. If you supply a full URL starting with `https://` it will be used as-is.

## Adding basic images
### Add a Local image
```markdown
---
image: image.jpg # Will load the following `_site/_media/image.jpg` 
---
```

### Add a Remote image
```markdown
---
image: https://cdn.example.com/image.jpg # Will load the URL directly
---
```

## Using the full power of the Image object to create rich and accessible images
If you want to be fancy you can supply extra data to the image. To do this you instead pass an array as the image parameter.

```markdown
---
image:
  source: image.jpg
  description: Alt text
  title: Tooltip
---

```

## Supported properties:

Here are the properties supported by the Image object, paired with examples and descriptions.

### Local image path
```yaml
path: _media/image.jpg
```

### Remote image URL

Will override the path property if both are set.
```yaml
url: https://example.com/media/image.jpg
```

### Alt description

Used for alt text for screen readers. You should always set this to provide accessibility.

```yaml
description: "This is an image of a cat sitting in a basket."
```

### Image title
Shows a tooltip on hover.
```yaml
title: "My Cat Archer"
```

### Copyright text
```yaml
copyright: "Copyright (c) 2020 John Doe"
```

### License name.
```yaml
license: "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0"
```

### License URL.
```yaml
licenseUrl: "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"
```

### Image author
The author of the image, for example, the photographer, illustrator, stock photo website, etc.
```yaml
author: "John Doe"
```

### Image source
Used together with the `author` property to give credit to the source of the image.

```yaml
credit: "htps://unsplash.com/photos/example"
```

## Practical example
Using all of the supported properties described above, we can create an image that is accessible and data-rich.

### The source markdown
```markdown

## Deep dive into the Image object
If you are a package developer, or just curious, here is an overview of how the Image object is created internally.

An `Image` object is created by passing an array of values to the constructor.

Here is an example, with all the supported properties, and example values.

```php
public static function exampleImage(): self
{
  return new Hyde\Framework\Models\Image([
    'path' => '_media/image.jpg',
    'url' => 'https://picsum.photos/300/200',
    'description' => 'A random image.',
    'title' => 'An image from Picsum',
    'copyright' => 'Copyright (c) 2022',
    'license' => 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0',
    'licenseUrl' => 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/',
    'credit' => 'https://picsum.photos',
    'author' => 'John Doe',
  ]);
}
