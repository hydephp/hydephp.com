# HydePHP Featured on Laravel News Creator Spotlight Podcast

Hi everyone! I'm Caen, creator of HydePHP. I'm excited to share that I recently had the pleasure of being interviewed by Eric L. Barnes for the Laravel News Creator Spotlight series. During our conversation, we dove deep into HydePHP, discussing everything from its core features and benefits to the challenges and rewards of maintaining an open-source project.

We explored several interesting topics, including:
- How HydePHP integrates with existing Laravel applications
- The philosophy behind providing an excellent developer experience
- Use cases beyond blogging, particularly in documentation
- A sneak peek at a project, Release.new, for generating release notes from Git history which I developed together with Jason McCreary from Laravel Shift.
