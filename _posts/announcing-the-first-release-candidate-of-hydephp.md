## Release Announcement 

We're excited to announce the first release candidate of HydePHP, a Laravel-based static site generator! HydePHP is a powerful and flexible tool that allows you to build static websites with ease, using the familiar syntax and functionality of the Laravel framework.

### What is HydePHP?

HydePHP is a static site generator that is built on top of Laravel, one of the most popular PHP frameworks out there. This means that if you're already familiar with Laravel, you'll find HydePHP to be very intuitive and easy to use.

### Release Candidate

With this release, we're one step closer to the first stable version of HydePHP. We encourage you to try out this release candidate and provide any feedback you may have, so that we can continue to improve the tool and make it even better.

### How to Install

To get started with HydePHP, you can install it using Composer with the following command:

```bash
composer create-project hyde/hyde --stability RC
```

### First Stable Release

We're planning to release the first stable version of HydePHP exactly one week from now, on March 14th, 2023. In the meantime, please give this release candidate a try and let us know what you think. Thanks for your support, and happy building!
