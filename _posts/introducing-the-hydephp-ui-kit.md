## Introducing the HydePHP UI Kit: More TailwindCSS Components for Your HydePHP Projects

I'm excited to introduce the HydePHP UI Kit, released at long last, featuring a curated collection of minimalistic and un-opinionated TailwindCSS Laravel Blade components designed specifically for HydePHP projects, providing a set of versatile building blocks to enhance your web development experience.

### Getting Started

Before diving into the UI kit, ensure you're familiar with [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/blade). You can also visit the [full UI kit documentation](https://hydephp.github.io/ui-kit/).

Next, simply install the package using Composer:

```bash
composer require hyde/ui-kit
```

### A first look at the components

Here are some of the components you can use to build your next project! Of course, all components support both light and dark mode out of the box, just like the rest of HydePHP.

### Buttons & Inputs

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::button-primary>
	Primary Button
</x-hyde-ui::button-primary>
```

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::button-secondary>
	Secondary Button
</x-hyde-ui::button-secondary>
```

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" value="John Doe" />
```

The base component `<x-hyde-ui::input />` supports additional attributes, as seen in the example above.


### Card

An incredibly versatile component with title and footer slots:

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::card>
	A card with some content.
</x-hyde-ui::card>
```

Combine components for more complex structures:

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::card>
    <x-slot name="title">
        My Amazing Card
    </x-slot>
    A card with content and a footer with a button.
    <x-slot name="footer" class="text-center">
        <x-hyde-ui::button-primary>
            Primary Button
        </x-hyde-ui::button-primary>
    </x-slot>
</x-hyde-ui::card>
```

### Typography Components

#### Heading

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::heading>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
</x-hyde-ui::heading>
```

#### Prose

Create an `<article>` element with [TailwindCSS Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) styles:

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::prose>
    <h2>Prose Heading</h2>
    <p>Prose paragraph</p>
</x-hyde-ui::prose>
```

#### Markdown

Convert Markdown to HTML using the Hyde Markdown compiler:

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::markdown>
    ## Markdown Heading
	
    Hello world!
</x-hyde-ui::markdown>
```

Remember to wrap Markdown in the prose element for styling.

### Putting It All Together

The HydePHP UI kit is intentionally minimal. It encourages you to mix and match components to build creative interfaces. Here's an idea to get you started: a customizable newsletter signup card:

```blade
<x-hyde-ui::card>
    <x-slot name="title">
        Let your creativity flow!
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="main" style="padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
        <x-hyde-ui::prose>
            <x-hyde-ui::markdown>
                The UI kit is minimal by design. It's up to **you** to create something _amazing_.

                Maybe create a form to collect newsletter subscriptions?
            </x-hyde-ui::markdown>
        </x-hyde-ui::prose>
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="footer" class="text-center flex">
        <x-hyde-ui::input placeholder="Enter email" />

        <x-hyde-ui::button-primary>
            Subscribe
        </x-hyde-ui::button-primary>
    </x-slot>
</x-hyde-ui::card>
```
