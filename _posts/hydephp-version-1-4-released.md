## Overview

**HydePHP v1.4 is now available for download!**

This new update brings a Live Edit feature and a bunch of other developer experience enhancements.

## Live Edit

The live edit feature allows you to quickly edit Markdown-based pages (posts, docs, and pages) directly in the browser.

To enter the live editor, simply double-click on the article you want to edit, and it will be replaced with a text editor.
When you're done, click the save button to save the changes to the page's source file.
