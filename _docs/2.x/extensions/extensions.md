# Extensions & Integrations

## HydePHP - Extensible by design

HydePHP is designed to be extensible, and comes with a number of built-in extensions and integrations,
as well as support for third-party extensions and integrations.

## First-Party Extensions & Integrations

### Realtime Compiler

The Hyde Realtime Compiler is included with Hyde installations and is what powers the `php hyde serve` command.
- Learn more about the [Realtime Compiler](realtime-compiler) in the documentation.

### UI Kit

The [HydePHP UI Kit](https://github.com/hydephp/ui-kit) is a set of minimalistic Blade & Tailwind components to kickstart development of custom Blade views for your HydePHP site.
- Learn more at https://github.com/hydephp/ui-kit and see the documentation at https://hydephp.github.io/ui-kit

### GitHub Action

The [GitHub Action for HydePHP](https://github.com/hydephp/action) is hands-down the easiest way to build and deploy your Hyde site to GitHub Pages.
- Learn more at https://github.com/hydephp/action and see the documentation at https://hydephp.github.io/action

## Integration with Third-Party Services

All third-party integrations are listed on the [Third-Party Integrations](third-party-integrations) page. Below is a summary.

### Torchlight

Torchlight is an amazing API for syntax highlighting, and is supported natively by HydePHP.
- Learn more about [Torchlight](third-party-integrations#torchlight) in the documentation.
