#### `isBooted()`

Determine if the Kernel has booted.

```php
Hyde::isBooted(): bool
```

#### `boot()`

Boot the Hyde Kernel and run the Auto-Discovery Process.

```php
Hyde::boot(): void
```

#### `booting()`

Register a new boot listener.

Your callback will be called before the kernel is booted. You can use this to register your own routes, pages, etc. The kernel instance will be passed to your callback.

```php
/** @param callable(\Hyde\Foundation\HydeKernel): void $callback */
Hyde::booting(callable(\Hyde\Foundation\HydeKernel): void): void
```

#### `booted()`

Register a new &quot;booted&quot; listener.

Your callback will be called after the kernel is booted. You can use this to run any logic after discovery has completed. The kernel instance will be passed to your callback.

```php
/** @param callable(\Hyde\Foundation\HydeKernel): void $callback */
Hyde::booted(callable(\Hyde\Foundation\HydeKernel): void): void
```
